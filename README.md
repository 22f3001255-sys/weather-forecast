## Round 2 Update

Upgrade the dashboard: support multiple cities with #city-tabs, show a 5-day temperature chart (#weather-chart) using Chart.js, add a theme toggle (#theme-toggle) persisting in localStorage, and a loading spinner (#loading-spinner). Use Intl.DateTimeFormat for dates and ensure mobile responsiveness with a viewport meta tag.

Below is the revised implementation of a weather forecast dashboard that includes the requested features. This implementation consists of the main `index.html`, supporting CSS and JS files, and a `README.md` explaining the changes.
